<p style="font-size:20px">Our website is a chrome extension for the visually impaired and the blind. It functions as a reader for Gmail. It was created using Gmail JS, Node, and Responsive Voice API. More extensively, we also included a website in which can be used for downloading and learning more about our project. In this website, there will be a homepage, download page, and a page that tracks our progress throughout this CodeDay. We used HTML and CSS for this creation. Hope you enjoy!</p>
